Arsenal: A Hearts of Iron 2 Mod Manager
by Lady Lambdadelta, March 2019

= USER MANUAL =

= Introduction =

Arsenal is a simple modification manager for Hearts of Iron 2 and games based on it (such as Arsenal of Democracy and Darkest Hour: A Hearts of Iron Game). It is released to the public under the terms of the Do What the Fuck You Want To Public License (WTFPL).

= How to Use =

1.	Put all of your modification files in their own folder (with the same name as the mod), with the same folder structure as the vanilla game files. Put these folders in another folder with a relevant name (for example, Arsenal Mod Staging).
2.	Run Arsenal - A Hearts of Iron 2 Mod Manager.exe. If this is your first time running it, you will see a dialog box warning you that you have not set a game install, mod staging or vanilla backup path. Press OK.
3.	On the window that appears (the main window of the mod manager), press the Path Setup button at the top centre of the window.
4.	The Arsenal Path Setup window will appear. Use the Browse buttons here to select the install location for your Hearts of Iron 2 game, as well as the Arsenal Mod Staging folder you created earlier and another folder to store a backup of the vanilla state of your game. When you have done this, press Close.
5.	Making sure that your game is currently unmodified, press the Create Vanilla Game Backup button. This will create a complete backup of the game files so that mods can be easily removed when not desired. If the game is updated to add or remove files, you will need to delete and re-create this vanilla backup â€“ be aware of this.
6.	Press the Refresh Mods List button to load the list of mods you have in your mod staging folder. These will appear in the Disabled Mods panel (on the left of the main window).
7.	Click on a mod you wish to activate in the Disabled Mods panel, then press the > button between the two panels to add it to the Enabled Mods panel. Repeat this process as necessary for however many mods you wish to activate.
8.	Use the Priority Up and Priority Down buttons on the bottom-right of the main window to set the order in which your enabled mods should be applied. Mods toward the bottom of the order will take precedence over mods toward the top of the order where there are file conflicts.
9.	Once you have enabled and sorted your mods to your liking, press the Deploy Mods button. This process make take a while, as there are many files to be copied, but once it is complete, a dialog box will appear informing you that the process is complete.
10.	Once the process is complete, you can exit Arsenal by pressing the Exit button at the bottom-centre of the main application window.
